This is how you do trailers. A single scene that shows the vibe of the film without revealing any major story arcs that would otherwise spoil an exciting film.
"10/10 trailer, no big plots revealed or spoilers, just action and a bit of lore!"
I love when a movie is so brilliant it feels like a video game that will never exist
Absolutely loved it. A non- stop action-thriller rivalling John Wick. Hemsworth and Farahani  are outstanding.
Absolutely love the long take realistic action sequences that modern action movies are doing!
"Hardcore actions
Eye-catching sequences
Top notch making
Brilliant direction "
This movie deserves a theatre release
That helicopter scene at the end is one of the best scenes ever made already. The cinemtography on that was Immense.
"Saw this movie today, hands down one of the best action film ever and especially the fights are "
"Como sempre, senquencias de filmagens sensacionais. Um dos filmes com as melhores jogadas de c√¢mera que j√° vi."
"There will always be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù movies, but these ridiculous action movies just absolutely do it for me. They remind me of when I was a kid, and the scenarios I‚Äôd set up for my action figures. Looking forward to this one."
This movie has a 21 minute long one shot that is absolutely beautiful. This needs to be nominated for some sort of award.
Please release it in the Theatre! This NEEDS IMAX
Finally. A movie filmed like a video game 
"I loved the part where Tyler Rake said ""It's extracting time!"" and extracted all over the place. Truly one of the most extractions ever."
At√© arrepiei... Daora demais!!
The trailer is absolutely brilliant. This is perfect example of how a trailer should be
"Damn love how brutal Chris is in this franchise. Not even just physically, but his whole demeanour too. This looks epic"
I can't wait!!! I freaking loved the first one its literally one of the best movies on Netflix
The cinematography is INSANE!!! I loved the first movie so I'm looking forward for this one
What a movie!! Would like to watch it on big screen again
"The greatest movie ever
No kiss scene included 
I could watch with my parents happily Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
This looks amazing im so excited the first film was so realistic and had a brilliant storyline  the action in this teaser trailer so far looks phenomenal  
Whoever made this trailer deserves an award. Well done.
"Probably the greatest action choreography ever.
Spine chilling experience, it feels like you're there! 10/10
John Wick, Fast Furious or any other action movies don't exite me after watching Extraction 1 & 2"
"PEL√çCULAS CON GRAN CALIDAD EN EL G√âNERO DE ACCI√ìN HAN SIDO EL DISTINTIVO DE NETFLIX ESTOS A√ëOS , Y ESPERAMOS SINCERAMENTE QUE VAYAMOS DE MENOS A M√ÅS Y DE BIEN A MEJOR CHRIS HEMSWORTH ES DE LO M√ÅS DESTACADO QUE TIENE HOLLYWOOD ACTUALMENTE PARA ESTE TIPO DE PRODUCCIONES . FELICIDADES NETFLIX Y GRACIAS ."
"Faz tempo que n√£o sei o que √© ficar sem folego ao ver um trailer.
Muito bom!"
One of the best teasers ever. This is how to hype people up about a film without showing much of the film or the plot. Amazing action flick and glad this is a Franchise.
Chris Hemsworth may have finally found another franchise with some staying power. I'm glad for him.
"Senhoras e senhores,
 
Aguardo ansiosamente pelo filme !
Espero que seja t√£o bom quanto o 1¬∫! "
Not gonna lie... I got goosebumps watching that last fight scene!  Movie looks awesome! Great work!
"The Vienna DC Tower scene was absolutely perfect!!
Thank you Netflix for this amazing action movie!!
Can't wait for part 3!!"
"Forgot that they said they‚Äôd do a third. Loved the first one, stoked for this one!"
One of the best action movie for me so far this year.
"This was actually a really good trailer, showed a lot of the chaos that‚Äôs about to unfold without actually revealing too much."
Easily the best action movie of the year. Good acting and believable amazing action makes this movie worth it of the big screen.  Can't wait for the third one
S√≥ esse trailer j√° foi melhor que a maioria dos filmes desse ano inteiros incluindo John wick
The part where the Molotov hits the shield and he just starts going crazy was top tier
I finally watched the first one because of this trailer and it did not disappoint in any way. Definitely want to see this one
Imagine the John Wick franchise without a theatrical release. This deserves to be in the theatres!
"I'm saying it now... its better than the first... goddamn this movie gripped me from start to finish.. and it is perfect in every way!the action scenes are more amazing than the first,the characters, especially the villain is amazing!and the story perfectly fits together with 1....  amazing amazing movie"
"This is more like a video game than a movie, and I love it."
"The first Extraction was great, and this one looks like it will be also!  Love the 1 scene trailer, so much fun."
Ufff what a fabulous movie it was.. Real action packed.. Love it just love it.. Want more and more and more parts of it.. Thank you Netflix
"Just seen this, mind-blowing. Now waiting for the part 3 Ô∏è."
You know the movie is about to be amazing and badass when the director himself used to work as a stuntman before working as a director
Huge Raid vibes from that prison yard fight!! This movie looks amazing!! Wish it had a theatre release!
The camera angles and production have been TOP TIER!!! cant wait for this to come out
The first one was so epic. Please make more of these. These blow John wick outta the water
I love this movie...make a part 3!
What a movie. every fight scenes is awesome..this movie deserves a theatre release ..
Extraction doesn't get enough credit. One of the best action films of this century. This sequel looks to follow suit.
"This is how action movies should be made, i got really hooked on the first one, can't wait for this release"
Okay we need a extraction 3 now
Can't wait for this movie on Netflix so excited for it. It's gonna be a banger for real
J√° na espera 
The camera movement and fight choreography.. Top tier
More please like that. Already seeing that each fight scene is not cutted into several bits of seconds material but one long take. Luv it.
This movie deserves to be on the big screens.
Best action movie for me so far 
1st one was amazing and this one looks awsome by the trailor and who ever made it deserves a award well done 
this should be shown in theatres!!!
An entire scene of the movie as a teaser. Totally loved it.
I've never been hit so hard in my feelings by an action movie 
"Need to rewatch the first one asap, such a dope movie and I‚Äôm excited for this one as well!!!"
I loved this movie!! Non stop action!!!!!!!!!!!
That long shot in the first movie was mint. Hopefully they‚Äôre doing it again
I don't usually feel the need to say this: what an amazing trailer!
I just love how gritty and down-to-earth the fight scenes feel in the first movie and this trailer. Can't wait.
"The first extraction was one of the best action movies I‚Äôve ever seen. It had real pathos, character development, you actually cared about the characters. Hope number two is good also. The trailer looks stupid‚Ä¶ But you can‚Äôt tell."
Extraction= Extra action Ô∏è
Just watched now finished like  the first one this also SUPER Great Movie Great actors Chris hemsworth great actor  hope they bring part 3 cant wait!!!!!!!
This needs to be in a theater
"You let a legit, experienced stuntman (or former stuntman) direct, he‚Äôll make the action insane. Because they know what looks good on camera. Case in point, Chad Stahelski & Sam Hargrave."
The first one really surprised me. Not only was it a great action flick but it had a surprisingly heartfelt story. Can't wait for 2.
Bravo!  Netflix has done it again by bringing us some of the most phenomenal action scenes ever! ü´°
This movie deserve a theatre  release
"Chris machine gunning the helicopter was epic, did not expect that scene. Felt like a videogame scene, even the camera angle. Nice one @Netflix"
I prayed they make a sequel and my prayers were answered
Our Australian James Bond is back and I LOVE IT!!!!
Great movie! Two thumps up deserved! 
"I loved the cinematography on the first one, and so glad to see this one has similar experimental scenes as well. Look at the transition from a hand held camera to one that is attached to Hemsworth‚Äôs body when he gets stunned by a hit at 00:32. After this, the camera is on a harness fixed to Hemsworth until 00:56, where it seamlessly cuts to the hand held camera once again. Brilliant, and so creative."
I genuinely can't remember the last time a move trailer got me this hyped up
Amazing cinematography and epic one shot action 
This movie should be released in theaters
The prison scene alone is worth the watch!!
"Man, I really want to see this in the theater! Maybe show both movies back to back double feature theatrical release?! What do you say Netflix?"
This movie deserves a theater release
Tyler is back! Sooooooo hyped!
Can we just watch the movie in trailer clips because that was AWESOME!
"Brilliant trailer. Makes me want to watch part 1 again. In fact, I think I will."
Hemsworth is such a badass in these films! Loved the first one! So excited!!!
Goosebumps.
Love how the camera transitioned from moving with Chris as if attached to him with a rig but then seamlessly detaching to show more in the frame. Love it
This one should definitely come out as a game
"Extraction was a Gem of a movie, real sleeper. Loved it, This trailer shows II is going to be Amazing again, After Love and Thunders flop, Looking forward to seeing Hemsworth actually acting."
"Oh, when I watched the first movie, I really liked it, but the ending was sad and so unexpected. It's cool that they saved him, Chris Hemsworth really showed himself amazing."
A trailer that doesn't give away the whole plot. I will watch.
"Looks badass, can't wait."
Really happy they're continuing from the first film. Extraction 1 blew me away and I wanted to see Hemsworth play this character again. Can't wait for this to be out!
Amazing it looks like it could be even better than the first
Masterclass of a trailer.
"Cinematography is on an another level 
This movie's about to go big 

Can't wait.."
I absolutely love that they didn't use any form of extreme shaky cam so they could actually show the fight choreography!
PLEASE RELEASE IN THEATRES 
Extraction franchise is like watching a Call of Duty movie. Nonstop action from beginning to end. Loved every second of it. Can‚Äôt wait for the next!
Kesintisiz √ßekim teknikleri √ßok iyi. Ger√ßekten aksiyon hissi veriyor.
Acho que poucas continua√ß√µes foram t√£o aguardadas como essa.
"Honestly, one of the best trailers I‚Äôve ever seen."
Looks even more action packed than the first one
What a great a creative trailer. So many trailers for action movies in particular are so by the numbers. This is what I‚Äôm talking about right here
Keep in mind this entire first sequence looks to be done all in one take. There are cuts but the beautiful transitions between them make it look seamless. This is going to be a movie of the summer for SURE
Personally I think the story was just okay in the first one but I liked the action sequences so I had a good time watching it. I don't really care about the story as long as it isn't stupid and the action is done well again.
Should be released in theatres. Wanna watch it in the big screen.
Finally!!! A movie that looks like it'd be worth watching
Masterpiece on his way
"I loved the rawness of the shots taken by Sam Hargrave in the first movie and his dedication as a first time director for those shots, beyond commendable."
Amazing I just cannot wait for this release!!!   
I want a theater release for this so badly
Dude this looks phenomenal
He was born for the role. Bad ass actor.
"Totally worth the hype, much better than the 1st movie"
Don't you just love it when the action is in sync with music? 
This is going to be the greatest Netflix movie ever
"If it's half as good as the first, it will be awesome!"
This movie is like video game.
I wish Saju from extraction 1 was in the extraction 2 because he and Tyler would be a great team
"No hates in this movie.
A really must watched for those who want a full action"
I'd never thought I'd ever see Chris Hemsworth in an action movie like extraction. Whoever trained him in fight choreography did an excellent job he looks like a real martial artist on the big screen
I am so very happy they made another. The first one was so good
"Bonkers Man, what a legit saga Extraction is becoming. I'm pumped."
Ya era hora!!!
Chris Hemsworth had phenomenal acting in the first Movie looking forward to watch this one as well
This Man Never Disappoints us and He has the real charisma of 90s Action Heroes.
Can't wait  love this character awesome trailer
"The fight scene reminds me a lot of Raid 2's prison riot, although that was more brutal, this looks really good."
√áa c'est du lourd
is so brilliant it feels like a video game that will never exist
waiting for extraction 3
"I love the way action movies are trending between this franchise, John Wick, and the Mission Impossible movies. I mean, a 2 min trailer somehow makes this series look even bigger and meaner than it already did. Cannot wait to see this."
This is gonna blow up the Netflix servers when it releases 
i can not wait to see this movie ! i am so hyped i can not wait ! OMFG !
Extraction is the closest thing we will get to a Modern Warfare franchise. Edits on shorts or tiktok make it feel like the most intense game of Warzone
This looks great! Loved the first one!
Looks freaking awesome 
The part where he starts fighting with his arm on fire at 1:15 is the one of the RAWEST THINGS I‚Äôve ever seen! So excited for this flick 
The ending shot with the machine gun just makes me think im playing a game....and I love it 
Netflix has a damn hit on their hands. I‚Äôm so fkn excited!!!
This looks absolutely amazing
This is a good trailer they didn‚Äôt give anything away from the plot. Makes me wanna watch it to find out what‚Äôs going to happen.
i got major resident evil 4 vibes from this and im loving it
This movie absolutely deserves a theatre release. Now this is how you do a trailer!
i love this style of trailer doesnt give away anything exept that its going to be an awsome movie
Holy moly I didn't think they'd make a second one
I‚Äôm ready for this!!!!
Hemsworth+ Russo bro's+ great trailer = must see movie.
This is the coolest trailer I've ever seen 
"I'm glad that we're in a time where we have both the John Wick franchise and Extraction, both fantastic movies in their own right for their own reasons. Can't wait!"
I like how they literately took inspired from the raid. This is a great movie
"Oh my goodness!!! 

One of the best trailers ever!!!"
Absolutely masterpiece 
"what the action, this trailer deserves everything"
This is an AMAZING movie !!
The transitions and cinematography in this teaser alone are amazing! Can‚Äôt wait to see the movie
Part 3 please! I like to watch this on big screen
Action movies are never out of Trend
the way he still shakes the gatling gun eventhough the ammo is out
Finally something good from Netflix
Chris Hemsworth beating the living shit out of multiple dudes with a flaming hand is an insane idea that I never thought I would wanted nor need to see
"That Molotov explosion on the riot shield was badass. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs practical effects, visual, or a combination, but the cinematography, effects, action, and especially sound effects/design are fantastic!"
Chris Hemsworth is a man who would be perfect for the Expendables
0:53 This camera sequence is pure brilliance...WOW
Give me more movies like this.
Loved it 
I don't think they ever thought these movies would be so big
That fight choreography is epic . Can‚Äôt wait for Hemsworth to kick some ass
"the first one was so much fun to watch, and i hope this will be the same."
"Extraction 1:         ? 
Extraction 2: Shield without Hammer

I can't wait for this part 2 "
omg this movie never disappoints 
Just from this video alone you know the movie's gonna be amazing.
The Chris Hemsworth we deserved in the Thor movies 
"This is one of the best teasers I‚Äôve seen in a long, LONG time. Surpassed my expectations honestly"
I am so on board for this. Extraction was awesome.
Super excited for this movie but still bummed we won‚Äôt get to see Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda be badasses together again. I really wanted to see more of them as a team.
"Editor: How epic do you want the trailer to be?
Movie Director: Yes!"
Yesssss!!!! Been waiting so long for this!
Yes. I love this trailer
The trailer didn't have to go this hard 
Love it when teasers focus mostly on one scene.
I cannot wait to watch this movie the 1st part was phenomenal
"Bro the fight scenes are awesome, i like how he fight with the burning arm. The scene where he shoots the minigun from the train, you can see how he shakes the gun so it would seem real. Other wise im looking forward to this movie af"
one of the best trailers period! what an amazing scene.
One of the best action film even seen
"I was not expecting that kind of well-choreographed, long-lasting and great-sounding action. I‚Äôm in."
I‚Äôm surprised and glad he survived 
Dude the first one was awesome. Really excited for this one.
The Extraction films deserve full theatrical releases but I‚Äôm happy to enjoy this in my home theatre too ü•π
This is how you do trailers. A single scene that shows the vibe of the film without revealing any major story arcs that would otherwise spoil an exciting film.
This movie deserves a theatre release
Please release it in the Theatre! This NEEDS IMAX
