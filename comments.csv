"What should I give my opinion about next?

This video inspired me to make a song my students, give it a listen on Spotify: D! : https://fanlink.to/KungFuKick"
I'm glad we men can have a conversation about women having an opinion.
This was so profound. This one video changed my entire perspective on the world and it made me rethink my beliefs and grow as a person
"As a woman living in the 1800s, this message has shown me that we should not have an opinion on anything. Thank you master."
"The guts and courage it takes to say the truth in today's world. 
Hats off to you Master"
"As a woman who’s been rejected for speaking my personal thoughts out, I can confirm that we do not In fact, deserve an opinion.

(Why the fuck does there always have to be a war in the replies, like seriously…)"
"Ur so brave that you came to the community to say this. Honestly, I don't think anyone else would be able to speak about this topic seriously
We love you!"
I can literally feel his respectful opinion coming inside of me
You gave that a lot of thought and tried to take in everyone's point of view on the situation which is very mature and I highly respect you for doing that. In my personal opinion and I'm sure many others I think your opinion is incredibly valid and should be put next to the Mona Lisa  this is truly life changing. Thank you for being so mature and bringing this to light.
I liked his thoughtful and powerful ideas that didn't offend anyone. There is an absolute objective point of view. I was especially touched when I went into details. Truly masterpiece
This is one of the most put-together and truly put facts I have ever heard. Thank you Master
Thank you master. Your unending wisdom continues to guide each and every one of us to a brighter future️
"Thanks for sharing. When I saw this, a spark was ignited inside me, all my past trauma, bad experiences, were all nullified, due to this truly inspiring thing you have just shared, it has truly brought out the best in me, for it is words of wisdom that I will never forget. Legit, the only way I’ll forget this is if I die a painful death under Obamas legs, his juicy thighs and plump cheeks will suffocate me as the knowledge of what you’ve shared squeezed out along with my internal organs, but that’s never gonna happen. What you shared today will remain with me from now till they day I die, in fact, no, in heaven when I’m asked to choose memories to keep. While others choose core memories with their family, friends, I’ll choose what you’ve shared today, because it’s the only thing I need, ever, what you’ve shared today will truly be sufficient to fuel me for the entirety of the remainder of my life, and the entirety of my after life, however if it works by reincarnation instead, well, as i slowly regain memories from my past life, I’ll definitely remember what you’ve shared today, as what you’ve shared is truly the most inspirational and important thing in the existence of the earth ever, if is more important than fundamental events like the big bang itself, what’s you’ve said holds more genius than anything alert Einstein and millions of other scientists have said all together, truly, what you’ve shared today is the most important thing ever in the history of the history of the history of the history of the world. In the history of the universe. In the history of the multiverse, in the history of the galaxy of universes, in the history of the cosmos, in the history of the big bang, in the history of the time before the Big bang, that’s how important what you’ve shared today is, it transcends the very creation, the very fabric of time and space as a concept. Even as you die, even before you were born, this remains true. What you’ve said has immortalized you"
These opinions are making me question my existence and encouraging me to do better things 
"As a woman, I can feel the respectful opinion coming inside of me"
What a powerful opinion. Truly changed my way of thinking. Thank you Master.
This man has single handedly solve every problem he comes across
"As a woman, this is very understandable. Have a good day."
Finally someone who gave his exact correct answer on this truly inspiring topic
I'm glad we men can have a conversation about women having an opinion in a theoretically acceptable manner
"Ah yes, another wisdom from the wise man himself, he spoke such beautiful words, it was just so pleasing to hear his opinion on what he thinks about the world… "
Very well articulated point.  Your wisdom is truly awe-inspiring.
"This was very inspirational, I can feel the spirit of masteroogway coming inside of me"
"I fully respect your opinion, in fact, you are brave to tell your opinion on this topic, couldn't agree more."
The importance of this matter and the answer that you gave us was beyond reach of our timid brain
"That is the most reasonable answer anyone could come up with, and I applaud you for it, Master."
"thank you so much for this wonderful opinion, this brings tears to my eyes"
"Once again, wise words from the Master, Oogway himself"
"I have never expected such a marvelous and exciting comeback. I am truly filled with joy and pure happiness when I see diplomats as ingenious as this grow, but it makes me truly speechless as I'm just unable to even put a tiny bit of what I feel into words. It's so marvelous, it makes me want to drink some fine white liquid while consuming some meat. Of course, both have to be properly prepared as badly cooked steaks and badly brewed white wines are rather disgusting if you ask me."
This master has more than infinite wisdom
Very good opinion. I will make sure to share this with the rest of the world
"He simply couldn't express the sheer amount of opinions he had and just shrugged

Truly a sigma"
Master never disappoints 
This opinion made me a little emotional. Thank you Master.
"Your opinion was on point! Don’t listen to the haters, they’re just jealous!"
"A very motivational quote from your master as always, I could hear your thoughts."
"this was a risky one, congrats on pulling it off the master "
I truly appreciate your opinion. Have a nice day 
"Master, I can feel your wisdom coming inside me"
"Really wise words, master."
"Just just... pure, beautiful and inspiring"

"I would have given my opinion on this, but  I am a woman"
"As a man I agree with your opinion, this is really a controversial topic master"
"""The person who always thinks nothing but thought"""
"That’s such a fascinating opinion, I have never thought of it that way"
No words needed to understand such wonderful meanings.
Bro gave us time to think about the question
As an opinion I can confirm that master words are in fact correct
"""My opinion on terrorism""
The hardest metal song in existence"
Master I understood this so clearly my eardrums popped and now I can hear again thank you.

What a brave way to share an opinion
"As a female individual of the human species, I confirm."

It depends on the environment they were raised in my opinion
Why did it take you so long to think about it. It's such an open topic with such an easy answer.
"The master said NO in the most bravest way possible
