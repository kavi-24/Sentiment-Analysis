This movie deserves a theatre release
"10/10 trailer, no big plots revealed or spoilers, just action and a bit of lore!"
I love when a movie is so brilliant it feels like a video game that will never exist
That helicopter scene at the end is one of the best scenes ever made already. The cinemtography on that was Immense.
Absolutely love the long take realistic action sequences that modern action movies are doing!
This looks amazing im so excited the first film was so realistic and had a brilliant storyline  the action in this teaser trailer so far looks phenomenal  
This is how you do trailers. A single scene that shows the vibe of the film without revealing any major story arcs that would otherwise spoil an exciting film.
Finally. A movie filmed like a video game 
Até arrepiei... Daora demais!!
"Como sempre, senquencias de filmagens sensacionais. Um dos filmes com as melhores jogadas de câmera que já vi."
"PELÍCULAS CON GRAN CALIDAD EN EL GÉNERO DE ACCIÓN HAN SIDO EL DISTINTIVO DE NETFLIX ESTOS AÑOS , Y ESPERAMOS SINCERAMENTE QUE VAYAMOS DE MENOS A MÁS Y DE BIEN A MEJOR CHRIS HEMSWORTH ES DE LO MÁS DESTACADO QUE TIENE HOLLYWOOD ACTUALMENTE PARA ESTE TIPO DE PRODUCCIONES . FELICIDADES NETFLIX Y GRACIAS ."
Please keep these movies coming they are exactly what fans want.
Whoever made this trailer deserves an award. Well done.
"There will always be “better” movies, but these ridiculous action movies just absolutely do it for me. They remind me of when I was a kid, and the scenarios I’d set up for my action figures. Looking forward to this one."
The cinematography is INSANE!!! I loved the first movie so I'm looking forward for this one
"Forgot that they said they’d do a third. Loved the first one, stoked for this one!"
Not gonna lie... I got goosebumps watching that last fight scene!  Movie looks awesome! Great work!
"Senhoras e senhores,
 
Aguardo ansiosamente pelo filme !
Espero que seja tão bom quanto o 1º! "
"Damn love how brutal Chris is in this franchise. Not even just physically, but his whole demeanour too. This looks epic"
"Faz tempo que não sei o que é ficar sem folego ao ver um trailer.
Muito bom!"
I can't wait!!! I freaking loved the first one its literally one of the best movies on Netflix
Best trailer for a film I've seen in years. If you show me how bad ass one fight sequence looks I can only assume the others are as good and am going to want to see them UNSPOILED!
More please like that. Already seeing that each fight scene is not cutted into several bits of seconds material but one long take. Luv it.
Please release it in the Theatre! This NEEDS IMAX
Can't wait for this movie on Netflix so excited for it. It's gonna be a banger for real
The camera angles and production have been TOP TIER!!! cant wait for this to come out
The takes in the first movie were GOD tier. Looks like Russo brothers know we want more of that.
I absolutely love that they didn't use any form of extreme shaky cam so they could actually show the fight choreography!
Chris Hemsworth may have finally found another franchise with some staying power. I'm glad for him.
"This is more like a video game than a movie, and I love it."
"Chris machine gunning the helicopter was epic, did not expect that scene. Felt like a videogame scene, even the camera angle. Nice one @Netflix"
"Need to rewatch the first one asap, such a dope movie and I’m excited for this one as well!!!"
This one should definitely come out as a game
This movie deserves a theater release
1st one was amazing and this one looks awsome by the trailor and who ever made it deserves a award well done 
I don't usually feel the need to say this: what an amazing trailer!
Já na espera 
"Brilliant trailer. Makes me want to watch part 1 again. In fact, I think I will."
Kesintisiz çekim teknikleri çok iyi. Gerçekten aksiyon hissi veriyor.
Imagine the John Wick franchise without a theatrical release. This deserves to be in the theatres!
I've seen the first one 3 times so far. I literally jumped out of my seat of excitement when I noticed the trailer. Can't wait.
He was born for the role. Bad ass actor.
Extraction= Extra action ️
"Is it just me, or did anyone else felt the same thrill and vibe during the scene where Cap faces off against the Winter Soldier, right before his mask falls off? What a buildup! The Russos never disappoint"
Absolutely masterpiece 
You know the movie is about to be amazing and badass when the director himself used to work as a stuntman before working as a director
"Definitely gonna watch this, saw the first one and loved it. Can’t wait!"
"The perfect performance, the strong characterization "
I watched the first when it released it was so good like Holy damn I'm do stoked for this one
"The fight scene reminds me a lot of Raid 2's prison riot, although that was more brutal, this looks really good."
I cannot wait to watch this movie the 1st part was phenomenal
"This was actually a really good trailer, showed a lot of the chaos that’s about to unfold without actually revealing too much."
Action movies are never out of Trend
This guy's something else in his Extraction movie [1/2]..his fighting's phenomenal 
The ending shot with the machine gun just makes me think im playing a game....and I love it 
"finally some action scenes were you can understand what happens (it's still a bit too shaky IMO, but this is going in the right direction). Now if we could have this + HFR..."
The trailer is absolutely brilliant. This is perfect example of how a trailer should be
Extraction doesn't get enough credit. One of the best action films of this century. This sequel looks to follow suit.
"Looks badass, can't wait."
"that scene look familiar for me, coz i watched the raid 2. but i cant wait for this movie appear at netflix "
That was amazing and the last scene looked like a video game scene.
Masterpiece on his way
First one was honestly almost on par with John Wick. I loved how hes just a huge guy fighting these skinny young kids it made sense. I hope this one doesnt just let him hulk over other big dudes and make it unbelievable (even for a dramatic unbelievable movie)
Can we just watch the movie in trailer clips because that was AWESOME!
Amazing cinematography and epic one shot action 
That long take has the potential to be the second greatest scene where a protagonist has to protect someone in the middle of a prison yard brawl
"I'll be honest, this is one of the best trailers I've ever seen. No kidding, just awesome"
The camera movement and fight choreography.. Top tier
Tyler is back! Sooooooo hyped!
Amazing I just cannot wait for this release!!!   
"Cinematography is on an another level 
This movie's about to go big 

Can't wait.."
I want a theater release for this so badly
What a great a creative trailer. So many trailers for action movies in particular are so by the numbers. This is what I’m talking about right here
An entire scene of the movie as a teaser. Totally loved it.
"The first extraction was one of the best action movies I’ve ever seen. It had real pathos, character development, you actually cared about the characters. Hope number two is good also. The trailer looks stupid… But you can’t tell."
Insane we dont even have to wait for cinema time anymore. Really wonder for this buisness of moviemaking further along… people get used to things really quick… this is movie materiel for sure 
Goosebumps.
Our Australian James Bond is back and I LOVE IT!!!!
The first one really surprised me. Not only was it a great action flick but it had a surprisingly heartfelt story. Can't wait for 2.
What a cool Trailer! Got me hyped about this! Very good job! That's a Trailer I want to see before a movie!!!!
Amazing it looks like it could be even better than the first
Hemsworth is such a badass in these films! Loved the first one! So excited!!!
Can't wait  love this character awesome trailer
i love this style of trailer doesnt give away anything exept that its going to be an awsome movie
"I loved the cinematography on the first one, and so glad to see this one has similar experimental scenes as well. Look at the transition from a hand held camera to one that is attached to Hemsworth’s body when he gets stunned by a hit at 00:32. After this, the camera is on a harness fixed to Hemsworth until 00:56, where it seamlessly cuts to the hand held camera once again. Brilliant, and so creative."
Bence muhteşem bir film olucak 
I'm honestly surprised at how good this trailer is... got chills.
"Oh my goodness!!! 

One of the best trailers ever!!!"
I wish this was in theaters but I'm just glad to have just enjoyed the ride
"Bonkers Man, what a legit saga Extraction is becoming. I'm pumped."
I just love how gritty and down-to-earth the fight scenes feel in the first movie and this trailer. Can't wait.
"The first one was great, this one looks even better. I can't wait to see it."
There's just no way the movie lives up to the trailer. That was too good.
Just saw the first one can't wait !!! 
Never heard of the movie but wow it looks amazing
Love how the camera transitioned from moving with Chris as if attached to him with a rig but then seamlessly detaching to show more in the frame. Love it
"Waiting for the release…
 This movie deserves a theatre experience "
SICK !! LOVE THE FIRST ONE AND THIS LOOKS KILLER !! CANT WAIT ! 
I am so very happy they made another. The first one was so good
Loved it 
I’m ready for this!!!!
"I don't know why, but I feel Chris Hemsworth really suits soldier movies. I swear if there was a movie based on Call of Duty modern warfare, I’d wanna see Chris as the leading role."
I loved the first one and this one looks freaking dope!!!
Goosebumps 
0:53 This camera sequence is pure brilliance...WOW
"I CAN'T BELIEVE, EXTRACTION PART 2 IS COMING LITERALLY, I'M SO EXCITED FOR THIS️"
"the first one was so much fun to watch, and i hope this will be the same."
Really happy they're continuing from the first film. Extraction 1 blew me away and I wanted to see Hemsworth play this character again. Can't wait for this to be out!
This is gonna blow up the Netflix servers when it releases 
Ça c'est du lourd
NEVER seen a trailer done like that... SO COOL
Yesssss!!!! Been waiting so long for this!
"DEFINITELY WATCHING THIS ! 
jeez Chris really shines in these roles"
"I love how they integrate the kid he's protecting into the action, like when he says to pull the pin. They did tons of it in the first movie, and that kid did a GREAT job with action."
"Can't wait for this, also looking out for the old guard 2, loved that!"
one of the best trailers period! what an amazing scene.
Dude this looks phenomenal
THAT is what Iron Fist is supposed to be - the flaming fist was just......WOW! 
Only one word. AWESOME. And I can't wait it to come out.
"I love the way action movies are trending between this franchise, John Wick, and the Mission Impossible movies. I mean, a 2 min trailer somehow makes this series look even bigger and meaner than it already did. Cannot wait to see this."
YES!! A trailer that very cleverly stimulates intrigue without over sharing
Welcome back Mr Extraction.. we patiently waiting 
Ya era hora!!!
"Now this is what i call a goddamn TEASER! not the same annoying trailer pattern formula, that throws already half of the movie plot at your face and still expects you to be get hyped for the flic. We need and deserve fresh teaser and trailers ideas!"
Yes. I love this trailer
Extraction franchise is like watching a Call of Duty movie. Nonstop action from beginning to end. Loved every second of it. Can’t wait for the next!
Fight scene is epic 
"Finally!
Now lat's wait for The Old Guard 2"
This is the coolest trailer I've ever seen 
That long shot in the first movie was mint. Hopefully they’re doing it again
The first movie was really good and underrated
"I loved the rawness of the shots taken by Sam Hargrave in the first movie and his dedication as a first time director for those shots, beyond commendable."
This looks great! Loved the first one!
Looks freaking awesome 
Netflix has a damn hit on their hands. I’m so fkn excited!!!
Holy moly I didn't think they'd make a second one
Extraction is the closest thing we will get to a Modern Warfare franchise. Edits on shorts or tiktok make it feel like the most intense game of Warzone
That fight choreography is epic . Can’t wait for Hemsworth to kick some ass
"Ayyyooooooooo! I didn't think they could top the first one but this one scene alone, what the actual fu**?! This is so cool!"
Best trailer in decades 
I hope this will be played in theatre............ the trailer just left me speechless
"Such a well done trailer, holy shit "
Hell of trailer ️
This Man Never Disappoints us and He has the real charisma of 90s Action Heroes.
Looks insane!!    can't wait!!
I'M SO EXCITED!
What a damn trailer 
"Oh, we needed this so bad..."
is so brilliant it feels like a video game that will never exist
The part where he starts fighting with his arm on fire at 1:15 is the one of the RAWEST THINGS I’ve ever seen! So excited for this flick 
YES! The trailer is so excellent.
A trailer that doesn't give away the whole plot. I will watch.
Another masterpiece of Russo brothers
Hemsworth+ Russo bro's+ great trailer = must see movie.
This looks absolutely amazing
Keep in mind this entire first sequence looks to be done all in one take. There are cuts but the beautiful transitions between them make it look seamless. This is going to be a movie of the summer for SURE
this is by far my favourite Chris Hemsworth role
excelente 0% amor 100% accion!
"Extraction 1:         ? 
Extraction 2: Shield without Hammer

I can't wait for this part 2 "
I would pay to watch this on the big screen. This trailer is fantastic.
Give me more movies like this.
"I'm glad that we're in a time where we have both the John Wick franchise and Extraction, both fantastic movies in their own right for their own reasons. Can't wait!"
This was pretty well done 
I am so on board for this. Extraction was awesome.
YEEEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!! Im excited for this to come out extraction is one of my fav movies
the way he still shakes the gatling gun eventhough the ammo is out
This is possibly the best action movie trailer I have ever seen in my life. Consider it a must watch on my list.
Can NOT wait!
I'd never thought I'd ever see Chris Hemsworth in an action movie like extraction. Whoever trained him in fight choreography did an excellent job he looks like a real martial artist on the big screen
I didn't think they would be able to bring him back after falling off the bridge but they did. wow.
"Oh, when I watched the first movie, I really liked it, but the ending was sad and so unexpected. It's cool that they saved him, Chris Hemsworth really showed himself amazing."
Wow love to watch this movie extremely waiting for this movie
As I saw the tralier I knew something's making it engaging. This was the best trailer I've ever seen.
"Can,'t waith for this part 2 ,first one if seen 5 times now ,amazing action"
"I don't know why, but I feel Chris Hemsworth really suits soldier movies."
Just from this video alone you know the movie's gonna be amazing.
This looks like one of those video game cutscenes that you’re just watching with your jaw dropped.
omg this movie never disappoints 
Can’t wait !!
Should be released in theatres. Wanna watch it in the big screen.
