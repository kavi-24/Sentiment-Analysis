"0% Rap

"He looks like a normal Teenager, But his Voice kills"
"I've been rickrolled so many times, I've lost count. But I still love this song. It's the perfect song to listen to when you're feeling down. It's so catchy and upbeat, and it always puts a smile on my face.



I remember the first time I was rickrolled. I was in high school, and I was clicking on links on the internet. I clicked on a link that said ""funny cat video,"" and it took me to the music video for ""Never Gonna Give You Up."" I was not really disappointed, but I also couldn't help but laugh."
"I don't care if I get rickroll, I just want to listen to this masterpiece "
"Despite the history of this song with the internet. At the end of the day, it's still a great song and forever classic."
Just one example of why the 80s was the best decade for music.
"One of the greatest songs of all time, Rick's voice is one of a kind. This gem never gets old!"
Keep rickrolling people till we get 1 billion views.

"all memes aside, i just come here to listen to it because its good."
"My young husband took me to see Rick, whilst he was doing all the things Rick's song promised he would not do. After 30 odd years I think that is why this song makes me happy, it is what I had hoped for in my marriage."
"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 2:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the chip go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the chip is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on chip . hail chip. hail chip . The spinning chip, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the chip spins, showing its lightly salt covered yellow skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the chip scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating chip. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of chip I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of chip I have ever seen especially on "
Still fire!

"Introduction:

Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is a pop song that was released in 1987. The song was written and produced by the Stock Aitken Waterman team, which was responsible for producing many other successful pop songs during the 1980s. “Never Gonna Give You Up” was a commercial success and topped the charts in 25 countries. The song’s success is not limited to the 1980s, as it has experienced a resurgence in popularity in the digital age due to the meme known as “rickrolling.” This review will analyze the song’s musical and lyrical elements, as well as the cultural significance of the song."
